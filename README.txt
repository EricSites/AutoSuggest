Version 1.4   -   Updated: Mar. 23, 2010

This Plug-In will auto-complete or auto-suggest completed search queries
for you as you type. You can add multiple selections and remove them on
the fly. It supports keybord navigation (UP + DOWN + RETURN), as well
as multiple AutoSuggest fields on the same page.

Inspied by the Autocomplete plugin by: Jšrn Zaefferer
and the Facelist plugin by: Ian Tearle (iantearle.com)

General usage and description of the options in Drew's version can be
found in his blog post (the second URL at the top of this file).

Additional options added since that blog post:

autoSelectFirstMatch - boolean - defaults to false
   auto-selects the first match without clicking or arrowing to it. More
   like default facebook behavior where you can type a few letters and 
   hit enter or tab to select the first match.

Modified the name of the post data parameter. Used to be as-values-X which
had nothing to do with the data posted. Modified to use the target element's
name plus the suffix "Values".
